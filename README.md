# PHP_selection_sort
1. Populate a sample array with 100 values (where each value is a random number between 0 to 10000). Implement a selection sort algorithm that returns a new array that's sorted (with smallest number on the left). Do this without creating another array.
2. Modify your code so that instead of just getting the minimum when doing the linear scan, it gets BOTH the maximum and the minimum and swaps two values after each linear scan.
3. Using php microtime() (http://php.net/manual/en/function.microtime.php) find out how many seconds this sorting took for 10000 values in the array.
